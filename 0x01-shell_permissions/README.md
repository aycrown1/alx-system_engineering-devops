 ## About


On a Linux system, each file and directory is assigned access rights for the owner of the file, the members of a group of related users, and everybody else. Rights can be assigned to read a file, to write a file, and to execute a file (i.e., run the file as a program).

The ls -l command is use to check the permission of a file or directory
      
     root@localhost:~# ls -l file
     -rw------- 1 root root 0 Feb  2 05:44 file
